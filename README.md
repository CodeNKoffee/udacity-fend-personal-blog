# Personal Blog Project

This repository contains the source code for my first project in the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program. As part of my journey, Iâ€™m both a **Frontend Nanodegree instructor** and a **student**. This project involves creating a personal blog using only HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple yet effective personal blog webpage that showcases basic web development skills, including:

- **HTML5 Semantic Elements** for structuring the content.
