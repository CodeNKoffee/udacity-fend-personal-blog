              Many traits separate humans from other creatures on this Earth. One of, if not THE most prominent of these traits is our Problem-Solving ability.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              The fuss about AI taking over human jobs is not new. It happened before when machines started making their way into factories and many times before and after that. The truth is, no matter how much we automate, there will always be some new problem for humans to solve, it&apos;s just our “thing”.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Through extensive studies and pattern recognition, we even have frameworks to approach problems. What this means, is that now we have the means to train our problem-solving muscles.

            <h2 class="article__header">Defining the problem</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Before solving anything, we need to know what the problem is in the first place. It is important to define what the real problem is, rather than chasing the symptoms.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              There are many ways to define the real problem. I will be sharing 2 approaches today.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">The 5 Whys technique</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This technique is a simple way to reach the root of the problem. By asking yourself “Why” 5 times in a row, you will force yourself to look deeper.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This technique is a simple way to reach the root of the problem. By asking yourself “Why” 5 times in a row, you will force yourself to look deeperYou can ask “Why” more or less than 5 times, depending on the problem. The main point is to not get satisfied with the first “Why” because often, it is not the real problem.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">The 5 Ws(+H) technique</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This is a more advanced technique than the 5 Whys that allows you to study the problem at a deeper level.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              You ask the following questions and make note of the replies:
            </p>

            <ol type="1" class="article__list">
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">1. What is the problem? What is reality like because of this problem? What will the reality be like if the problem continues?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">2. Who does this problem impact, directly and indirectly? (This could include people and/or animals.) Who contributes to the problem (for example, specific corporations, governments, and/or individuals)?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">3. When did the problem begin? When does the problem occur? When does it need to be resolved?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">4. Where is this problem occurring? (And what is the context in which it occurs?)</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">5. Why is the problem happening? Why is it important to solve the problem? (highlight the pain)</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">6. How would the world be different in the problem were solved?</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              By the end of this exercise, you should have a deeper understanding of the problem, its consequences and why it needs to be solved.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">The problem statement</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Armed with the knowledge from the previous techniques, you are ready for the final step of identifying the problem — The problem statement.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              A problem statement is a concise and clear statement that describes a specific problem, its significance and who it affects. It identifies the gap between the current state and the desired state
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This is what you will say when someone asks you “What&apos;s the problem”.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">Approaches</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Now that you know what the problem is, you can start thinking about how to solve it. Again, there are many approaches to solving a problem, but I will be sharing only two.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">The Cool Head, Warm Heart model</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              The Cool Head, Warm Heart model is a simple but effective way to solve problems. It involves two steps:
            </p>

            <ol type="1" class="article__list">
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">1. Cool Head: In this step, you take a step back and try to think about the problem objectively. You try to identify the root cause of the problem and come up with a solution that is both feasible and effective.</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">2. In this step, you consider the emotional impact of the problem on those involved. You try to find a fair solution and that will minimize the negative impact on those affected.</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              The Cool Head, Warm Heart model is a good way to solve problems that are complex or that have a significant emotional impact. It can help you to find a solution that is both effective, fair and align with your values.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This framework is often used in interpersonal and social contexts where ethical considerations are required, such as leadership, communication, and conflict resolution.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">The Mckinsey problem-solving framework</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              The McKinsey problem-solving framework is a more structured approach to problem-solving. It involves the following steps:
            </p>

            <ol type="1" class="article__list">
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">1. Define the problem: The first step is to define the problem clearly and concisely. What is the problem? Who is affected by the problem? What are the consequences of the problem?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">2. Gather information: The next step is to gather information about the problem. This information can come from a variety of sources, such as interviews, surveys, and data analysis.</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">3. Analyze the information: Once you have gathered information, you need to analyze it to identify the root cause of the problem. What are the underlying factors that are contributing to the problem?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">4. Develop solutions: Once you have identified the root cause of the problem, you can start to develop solutions. What are the different ways to solve the problem? What are the pros and cons of each solution?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">5. Choose a solution: Once you have developed a few solutions, you need to choose the best one. What solution is most likely to be effective? What solution is most feasible?</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">6. Implement the solution: Once you have chosen a solution, you need to implement it. This may involve making changes to policies, procedures, or systems.</li>
              <li class="about-me__info--para article__para">7. Evaluate the solution: Once you have implemented the solution, you need to evaluate its effectiveness. Did the solution solve the problem? Were there any unintended consequences?</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              The McKinsey problem-solving framework is extremely helpful when you want to take a more logic-first approach to solve your problem.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
