              Empathy is one of those things that you would think should be like that one setting that&apos;s turned on by default. What you might not yet realise is that it IS turned on by default, you “just” need to learn how to use it.

            <h2 class="article__header">What is Empathy?</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. Think about the time you were watching a movie scene where a child loses their parents in an accident and you felt a deep sense of sadness and loss for the child. You could imagine how scared and alone they must feel, and you wanted to reach out and comfort them. This is an example of empathy in action.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              It is easy for us to empathise with extreme circumstances like the loss of parents or a child, the real challenge appears when you need to empathise with everyday actions. Why is that student always late? Why is it that everyone seems to have such a negative outlook on life? Why don&apos;t people just read???
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">Why Empathise?</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              You might be wondering why you need to empathise with frivolous things like that. Shouldn&apos;t people just be able to manage their time, have a positive outlook and read? Why should I even attempt to understand them?
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              To this, let me ask you, what would you do if I told you that this person can&apos;t read because he grew up with no money and had to work day and night to provide for his siblings so that THEY can learn and be able to read?
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Now it is apparent why empathising is crucial.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Connecting</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy is a powerful emotion that can help us connect with others on a deeper level. It allows us to understand and share the feelings of others, even when we have never experienced those feelings ourselves. Empathy is essential for building strong relationships and creating a more compassionate world.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Connecting</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy is also paramount for resolving conflict. When both parties know how the other feel and understand they are similar in more ways than one, there will be no reason for them to continue fighting.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This is true starting from classroom squabbles to world wars.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Furthermore, empathy can help to find creative solutions to the conflict. When we can see the conflict from both sides, we are more likely to come up with solutions that meet the needs of everyone involved. This can lead to a more lasting and satisfying resolution.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Inspiring agreement</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              When you know how to empathise with others, you can create constructive arguments that convince the other person of what you are saying, or even come up with a different solution that&apos;s better than the sum of solutions you were arguing about in the first place.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              This is beneficial everywhere, from getting your children to clean their room to asking an employee to edit their work to look a certain way, rather than using the “Just do it” approach.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">How to empathise?</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathising on this level is hard. Like all aspects of emotional intelligence, it requires a great deal of self-awareness and self-regulation. However, like most things, empathy is a skill that we can develop with enough training.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Deep listening</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Before you make your diagnosis, listen actively to what the other person is saying.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              When someone is talking to you, really listen to what they are saying. Pay attention to their words, their tone of voice, and their body language.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Even if you can&apos;t yet empathise with them, just listen. With experience, you will be able to feel the weight of the words being spoken by the other person.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Questioning</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Just like classrooms, the best way to understand is to ask questions. Asking the person questions and allowing them to elaborate will help you form a clear image of their perspective.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              It also shows the person that you are listening and are interested in what they have to say, so they will open up to you even more.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Talk to people from different backgrounds</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Restricting yourself to a certain type of people will narrow down your perspective and will make it hard with you to understand people coming from different backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Therefore, it is best to have a diversified friend group. This way you will be constantly exploring new ways of thinking.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">When to empathise?</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathising is a great tool that will help in shaping your character, however, you shouldn&apos;t move to the other extreme.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathising is part of emotional intelligence, meaning you need to be conscious when using it, to avoid falling into traps set by others. You should learn to be vulnerable on your terms and when you wish to be.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy shouldn&apos;t be a door for other people to manipulate you or cause you stress, by giving you more than you can handle.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy also doesn&apos;t mean you should abandon your beliefs and creed. It is an extension of the way you perceive the world and interact with others, not a source of information as to how you should do things or what you should believe — here comes the tricky part of self-awareness and self-regulation again.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Once you master empathy it will not be just a button that you click to enable, it will be a slider that you can move in whichever direction you choose at any given moment.
            </p>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Examples of when empathy should be high include:
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Leading</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              In the context of leadership, empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of your team members. Leaders need to be empathetic because it allows them to build trust and rapport with their team members, create a more positive and productive work environment, and make better decisions.
            </p>

            <h3 class="article__sub-header">Helping others</h3>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              In the context of helping others, empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of the person you are helping. Helpers need to be empathetic because it allows them to connect with the person they are helping on a deeper level, understand their needs, and provide more effective assistance.
            </p>

            <h2 class="article__header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="about-me__info--para article__para">
              Empathy is a powerful emotion that can help us connect with others, resolve conflict, and inspire agreement. It is a skill that we can all develop with time and practice. However, it is important to use empathy wisely and not let it be used to manipulate us or cause us stress.
